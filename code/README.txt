If you wanna train the model, it will require 2 directories namely 'train' and 'test1'. These directories are supposed to contain images of cats and dogs, but because git doesn't track large files, I haven't included those directories(folders). 

'train' directory:
	This directory should contain images of cats and dogs in the following format - cat.123.jpg , cat.4312.png , dog.123.jpg ,dog.3214.png
	
	Here is google drive link to download the dataset - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nRHk55pP68rDauMBoLiTG9M1zvHhHkuF/view?usp=sharing 

	Download 'dogs-vs-cats.zip' and extract it. It will contain 2 folders, train.zip and test1.zip . Extract those folders. Then, copy those extracted folders ('train' & 'test') in this directory(current directory where 'code.py' / 'catdog_train.ipynb' is present). 


NOTE 2:
 The model trained using the CNN architecture written in 'code.py' and 'catdog_train.ipynb' is available on google drive. It's size is 500 MB.
